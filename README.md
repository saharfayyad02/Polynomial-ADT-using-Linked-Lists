# Polynomial ADT using Linked Lists

This project implements a Polynomial Abstract Data Type (ADT) using doubly-linked lists. It reads polynomial equations from a file called `equations.txt`, stores each equation in a doubly-linked list, and allows users to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication on the polynomials.

## Features

- Read polynomial equations from `equations.txt` and store them in doubly-linked lists.
- Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations on polynomials.
- Allow users to choose operations through a menu.
- Display the output of the selected operation.
- Option to store the results of all operations in a file called `results.txt`.
- Provide an option for users to substitute a value for the variable term in the equation.

## Input File Example: equations.txt
  1. 2x^7 + 10x^5 - 10x^3 + 2x + 1
  2. -15x^7 - 10x^5 + 90x^2 - 2
  3. 2x^2 + x - 1

## Usage

1. Compile the program.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Choose an operation from the menu:
   - **Addition**: Add two polynomials.
   - **Subtraction**: Subtract one polynomial from another.
   - **Multiplication**: Multiply two polynomials.
   - **Substitute Value**: Substitute a value for the variable term in the equation.
   - **Exit**: Terminate the program.
4. View the output of the selected operation.
